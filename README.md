Elevator 2 Lift Demo Template

The "Elevator 2 Lift Demo Template" is an interactive web application that simulates the operation of two elevator lifts in a multi-story building.
Created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project showcases a responsive user interface with two distinct keypads for selecting floors. 
The elevator doors respond interactively to floor changes, complete with open and close animations. 
To enhance realism, the project incorporates sound effects to mimic the operation of the elevators, including running sounds and door open/close sounds.
